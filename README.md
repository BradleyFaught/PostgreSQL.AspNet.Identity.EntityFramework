# PostgreSQL.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework

ASP.NET Identity 2.0 provider that use Entity Framework for PostgreSQL.

This is a port of the [ASPNET Identity for SQL Server](https://aspnetidentity.codeplex.com/). This project got a jump start from [AspNet.Identity.PostgreSQL](https://github.com/danellos/AspNet.Identity.PostgreSQL) project which is also a AspNet Identity provider that uses PostgreSQL, but does not use Entity Framework.

## Demo Project
An ASP.NET MVC5 template project is included to show it in action. To run the demo project:

1. Run the PostgreSQLIdentity.sql script to create the identity tables in your postgreSQL database
2. Update the web.config DefaultConnection connection string to point to your database
